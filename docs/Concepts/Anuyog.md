# 4 Anuyogas

Based on the depiction methods, the Jainism Literature can be categorized into 4 types, known as **"Anuyogas"**. They are namely:

1. Prathmanuyog
2. Karnanuyog
3. Charnanuyog
4. Dravyanuyog

Fundamentally, all the scriptures preach **Veetragta** and depict the path of eternal bliss i.e. Moksh. They are represented and explained in different style by focusing on some particular aspects which are actually known as **Anuyogas**. 


### Prathmanuyog

**Prathmanuyog** talks about the historical events and chronicles of various great personalities ([63 Shalaka Purush](./../Insights//Shalaka%20Purush/Introduction.md)) like 24 Tirthankars, 12 Chakravartis, great Jain Saints etc. It is filled with the Vairagya (mortification/renunciation) and various spiritual teachings, ethics, morals etc. are beautifully served in the form of stories. 

### Karnanuyog
The modern words to express Karnanuyog are 'Cosmology', 'Metaphysics', 'Astrophysics', 'Atomic Particle Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Biological Sciences' etc. Yes, **Karnanuyog** is nothing but science. It talks about the [Karma Theory](./Karma%20Theory/part1.md), 6 Existents of the Universe ([6 Dravya](./6%20Dravyas/part0.md)), Life Forms, complex mathematics and absolute numeral system, the Universe etc. Gunasthan, Marganasthan, 3 lok, Jeev-samas, Karma-siddhant etc. are some of the topics included in it.

Because it talks about the laws of nature, it is completely logical, straight-forward and factual. Karnanuyog Scriptures are a great resource for us to **mightiness** of **Kevalgyaan** (infinite intelligence) and hence also makes us realize our potential to achieve that state.
