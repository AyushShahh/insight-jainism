## Shalaka Purush (Great men)

> The Universe is considered as without any beginning or end - Infinite. Thus, the entity "Time" is also Infinite.

> The "Cosmic Wheel of Time" signifies that even though Time is Infinite, the Universe is repetitive and repeats itself.

> Thus the time is divided into infinite equal "Time Cycles" that keep on repeating infinitely called as "KAAL CHAKRA".
