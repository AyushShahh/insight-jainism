We can see 5 **Mlech-khands** and 1 **Aryakhand**. 

The Chakravarti rules this whole Bharat Kshetra (area of Bharat-Kshetra is **526 6/19 yojana** which roughly translates to **31,57,894.73684 km**) and it comprises of **6 Continents (known as Khands)**

Currently, we are living in **Arya-khand**. Aryakhand's very small part is actually what we call "Earth" today.

Like there are 24 Tirthankars, similarly there are a total of 12 Chakravartis in each epoch.

There are **9 Nidhis (Treasures)** that a Chakravarti has. These 9 Nidhis are in a form of a large square-shaped bucket-like structure (like a square-shaped 8 wheeled gigantic car as described in Triloksara). 

From that, different types of precious, valuable and supreme quality belongings are obtained and used by the Chakravarti. These 9 Nidhis are as below:

1. **Kaal** - Gives materialistic possessions based on seasons
2. **Mahakaal** - Gives vessels, etc.

7. **Pasya** - Gives different types of clothes like of silk, suti etc.
8. **Pingal** - Gives Crown, etc. different ornaments, belongings

In short, Chakravartis possess immense wealth and power; more than any one else in the human world. But still, these material wealth and power cannot lead to true and eternal happiness; and one day this great majesty of the Chakravarti also perishes into soil.

A Chakravarti, if he renounces these worldly pleasures; can become **God** (like Bharat Chakravarti) or go to **heaven**. Alternatively, if a Chakravarti becomes a slave of his senses, wealth, power, belongings etc. goes compulsorily to the **hell**.
