## What are Shalaka Purush?

**Shalaka Purush** are the great personalities born in the 4th era of each half-cycle epoch (Utsarpini and Avasarpini kaal) and gain immense fame and power by their virtuous deeds and contributions to the world. They are also considered to be the major torch-bearers for spreading Jainism on earth.

The Universe is considered as without any beginning or end - Infinite. Thus, the entity "Time" is also Infinite.

The "Cosmic Wheel of Time" signifies that even though Time is Infinite, the Universe is repetitive and repeats itself.

Thus the time is divided into infinite equal "Time Cycles" that keep on repeating infinitely called as "KAAL CHAKRA".

The "Kaal Chakra" is divided into 2 Epochs.

- Avasarpini (Descending in terms of happiness)
- Utsarpini (Ascending in terms of happiness)
